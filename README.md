# Waffle Iron
Because waffles are delicious.

===========

## What is Waffle Iron?
Waffle Iron is a "semantic" non-intrusive grid system powered by SASS/SCSS. No floats, no extra classes and no non-sense. It just works.

### What? No floats?
Inline block is your new friend, friend. No floats mean that you don't have to clear them.
### No extra classes
Pssh! No .col-06? No .fivecol? That's unpossible!
The trick here is to use semantic markup and CSS for all you elements.

### Responsive by nature
Built into Waffle Iron are some handy helpers to get your site all responsive. At a given point it will drop to a fluid layout and then down to a mobile layout. Turn them off if you would like.

### Drop in grid
Drop Waffle Iron in where you need a grid. Leave it out where it doesn't make sense. Write your CSS as fast as you can.

## Why should I use it?
Cause its awesome and fast. If you don't want to use it half way though a project you can easily pull it out and write your own CSS without needed to rewrite your markup or change your CSS.

## Support
Waffle Iron works without any hacks in Safari, Chrome, Firefox and IE8+. If you use html tag conditionals IE7 support is built in, otherwise you'll have to tweek some things by adding the IE7 inline-block hack:

	display: inline;
	zoom: 1;

## Ok I'm convinced
1. Use SASS/SCSS
2. Download the grid file
3. Write your markup semantically
4. Add the Waffle mixins to your scss
5. Enjoy a flexible grid that you can drop in where you want.
